A straight talking washed up movie star with a Southern drawl, the formally famous artist cinched the nomination in a near desolate field following Rockefellers dramatic dropout. He's got to keep the skeletons in the closet, unite a fractured party and deliver a win for the party of Lincoln's toughest election to date. But it can all blow up in his face. The liberal and conservative factions are knawing at the party's sides, both threatening to buck you should something go afowel.<br><br>But the Democrats aren't down for the count. After the McGovern/Carter debacle of '72, they've given up on appealing to anyone leaning right. Nowk they've put all their stock into the growing grassroots movement of leftist Lyndon LaRouche. The<br>demagogic Congress member is vowing to deliver an America that works for everyone, not just the elites. But he has a pretty backwards idea about who is considered an elite. So long as he can keep a handle on his more extreme views, New Left LaRouche can sail in ease to the White House.<br><br>The stage of America's bicentennial is set. And the winner will have America's soul.<br><br>God help us all.</div>",
